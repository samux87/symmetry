Symmetry Detection
------------------


A symmetry detection algorithm implemented in Cython/Python. This was
developed as part of an assignment during the [Computer Vision](http://cs.nyu.edu/courses/fall15/CSCI-GA.2271-001/)
 course at NYU. The ideas used were provided by [Davi Geiger](http://cs.nyu.edu/geiger/)
 and [Marcelo Cicconet](http://marceloc.net/)
